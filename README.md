# hermes-remote

The desktop half of a phone client for a live [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)
session on the LAN. The phone half is `%USERPROFILE%\AndroidStudioProjects\HermesRemote`.

`docs/PLAN.md` is the contract and the reasoning. Read it first; this file is only the map.

## Why a plugin and not a fork

`hermes-agent` is upstream NousResearch code that `hermes update` pulls, and its
`plugins/AGENTS.md` says plugins never touch core. So this lives out of tree and reaches
Hermes through `register(ctx)` alone.

Hermes discovers plugins in `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/`, which on this machine is
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\plugins\`. The working copy stays here and appears there as a
directory junction:

```
mklink /J "%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\plugins\hermes-remote" "%USERPROFILE%\source\repos\hermes-remote\plugin"
```

No administrator rights needed for a junction.

## Layout

| path | what |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin/` | the Hermes plugin: token auth provider, pairing CLI, TLS listener |
| `docs/PLAN.md` | the plan, the protocol findings, the risks |

## Status

Phase 0. Nothing in `plugin/` yet — the current step is proving the backend path with the
stock dashboard and no new code. See `docs/PLAN.md` §3.
